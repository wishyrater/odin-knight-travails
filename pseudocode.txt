we have a chessboard of 7x7 squares
each square is a vertex. meaning, it's a node with edges (connections) to other vertices

when the knight gets a starting position, we need to fetch that vertex
then, we need to explore all possible paths from that vertex to the destination vertex
store the successful paths, and show the shortest one, defined as the path with fewest steps
